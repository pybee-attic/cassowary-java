cassowary-java
==============

Cassowary-java is a pure Java implementation of the `Cassowary constraint-solving algorithm`_.

Cassowary is the algorithm that forms the core of the OS X and iOS visual
layout mechanism.

Quickstart
----------
Gradle users

Add the maven url to your project's ``build.gradle``

::

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
            maven {
                url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexbirkett/maven-repository/master/"
            }
        }
    }
    
Add the dependency

:: 

    dependencies {
        compile "org.pybee:cassowary:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
    }


Publishing cassowary-java to a maven repoisitory
------------------------------------------------

cassowary-java can be published to a maven repo using the following command

:: 

    ./gradlew publish -PmavenSnapshotsUrl=<url>  -PmavenUsername=<username> -PmavenPassword=<password>

Where <url>, <username> and <password> should be substituted with the server url, username and password.

Community
---------

Cassowary-java is part of the `BeeWare suite`_. You can talk to the community through:

* `@pybeeware on Twitter`_

* The `BeeWare Users Mailing list`_, for questions about how to use the BeeWare suite.

* The `BeeWare Developers Mailing list`_, for discussing the development of new features in the BeeWare suite, and ideas for new tools for the suite.

The Cassowary community also has `a mailing list`_; it provides more general
assistance regarding the Cassowary algorithm itself.

Contributing

The Cassowary implementation is a fork of the original Java library published
by Greg J. Badros.

The Cassowary code has been updated to be compliant with Java 1.4+, removes
and simplifies certain features, and applies a consistent coding style guide.
